create a class with object that tells a nurse the frequency of medicine that a patient must take, 
i.e. a system to tell patients when to take medication using java

public class Patient{
	private String name;
	private int age;

}

public class MedicineReminder{

}

public abstract class Allergy{
    private String reporter;
    private String symptoms;
    private int timeReported;
    private int severity; 
//Higher the number, higher the severity. more info on 1point3acres.com

    public Allergy(String reporter, String symptoms, int timeReported, int severity){.
        this.reporter=reporter;
        this.symptoms=symptoms;. 
        this.timeReported=timeReported;.
        this.severity=severity;
    }

    public void setReporter(String reporter){
        this.reporter=reporter;. 
    }

    public void setSymptoms(String symptoms){
        this.symptoms=symptoms;.
    }.

    public void setSeverity(int severity){
        this.severity=severity;
    }

    public void setTimeReported(int timeReported){
        this.timeReported=timeReported;
    }
    public String getReporter(){
        return reporter;
    }

    public String getSymptoms(){
        return symptoms;. 
    }. 

    public int getSeverity(){
        return severity;
    }

    public int getTimeReported(){.
        return timeReported;.

Design a class Make an object that holds temperatures of a person and can say whether or not they have a fever using java




design a BST with CERNER as an input.

Show me how you would write a program that stores information about a patient's medications.  
What about test-driven development ? How do you learn ? Design an allergy class 

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:
 first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function,
  then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.
Add a test
Run all tests and see if the new one fails
Write some code
Run tests
Refactor code
Repeat

design an address class
Write an allergy class with symptoms and reactions.  
Name a team project you have completed and some of the difficulties that came with it. 

Explain the differences between searching through a linked list vs. a binary tree  
Binary tree will be faster. O(log n) vs O(n)

if you were designing a program to simulate a game like chess or checkers, explain some of the classes that you would create to achieve this.
