parking lot - multiple levels
level -- multiple rows of spots

motocycle spots / compact spots / large spots

public enum VehicleSize {
	Motocycle,
	Compact,
	Large
}

Private
Like youd think, only the class in which it is declared can see it.

Package Private
Can only be seen and used by the package in which it was declared. This is the default in Java (which some see as a mistake).

Protected
Package Private + can be seen by subclasses or package member.

Public
Everyone can see it.


Yes, an abstract class can have a constructor. Consider this:

abstract class Product { 
    int multiplyBy;
    public Product( int multiplyBy ) {
        this.multiplyBy = multiplyBy;
    }

    public int mutiply(int val) {
       return multiplyBy * val;
    }
}

class TimesTwo extends Product {
    public TimesTwo() {
        super(2);
    }
}

class TimesWhat extends Product {
    public TimesWhat(int what) {
        super(what);
    }
}
The superclass Product is abstract and has a constructor. 
The concrete class TimesTwo has a constructor that just hardcodes the value 2. 
The concrete class TimesWhat has a constructor that allows the caller to specify 
the value.


Abstract constructors will frequently be used to enforce class constraints or 
invariants such as the minimum fields required to setup the class.

NOTE: As there is no default (or no-arg) constructor in the parent abstract class 
the constructor used in subclasses must be specified.


This is a most frequently asked java interview question. 
The answer is No, interface cannot have constructors. 
In this post we will discuss why

Lets come to the point now: All the methods of interface doesnâ€™t 
have body so there is no need to call the methods in the interface itself. 
In order to call any method we need an object since there is no need 
to have object of interface, there is no need of having constructor in 
interface (Constructor is being called during creation of object).

//abstract class here!!
public abstract class Vehicle{
	protected List<Spot> spots = new ArrayList<>();
	protected String car_id; // this could be the license plate of the car

	//the following two actually are similar
	protected int spotsNeed; // every car has this feature
	protected VehicleSize size;//could only be one of the three size

	//this is going to be shared by subclasses and thus protected
	//if just a class then private

	public int getSoptsNeed(){
		return spotsNeed;
	}
	public VehicleSize getSize(){

	//park into the spots

Declaring the field as 'final' will ensure that the field 
is a constant and cannot change. The difference comes in the 
usage of 'static' keyword.

Declaring a field as static means that it is associated with 
the type and not with the instances. i.e. only one copy of the field
 will be present for all the objects and not individual copy for each object. 
 Due to this, the static fields can be accessed through the class name.


Just having final will have the intended effect.

Declaring static is making it a class variable, 
this would be accessed through the class name .x.


public class Level{
	//level has spots
	//level is contained by parking lot'
	private int floor;
	private Spot[] spots;
	private int availableSpots = 0;
	private static final int SPOT_PER_ROW = 10;

	public level(int flr, int numberSpots){

	}

	public int availableSpots(){
		return availableSpots;
	}
	public void spotFreed(){
		availableSpots++;
	}
	public boolean parkVehicle(Vehicle v){

	}
	public boolean parkVehicleAt(Vehicle v, int num){
		//park it starting from a specific number
	}

	private int findAvailableSpots(Vehicle v){

	}
}

public class ParkingLot{
	private level[] levels;
	private final int NUM_LEVELS = 5;


	public ParkingLot(){

	}

	public boolean parkVehicle(Vehicle v){
		//again we have this
	}
}
